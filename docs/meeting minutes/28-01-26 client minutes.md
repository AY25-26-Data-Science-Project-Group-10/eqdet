### Minutes:
These are discussion points not covered in the slides sent by Matt.t 
1. Project details:
    - Deliverables
      - ISUH has requires no specific model performance metrics; the standard ones (i.e. precision, recall, accuracy etc.) are enough
      - The only benchmark our model needs to be compared against is STA/LTA, algorithm is available in ObsPy library
      - ISUH would like a report including model performance metrics and methods to reproduce our model
      - ISUH has yet to experiment between pretrained EQCCT model and an EQCCT model trained purely on Finnish data. We can evaluate the performance of both.

    - Model requirements
      - Phase picking is the primary task, others (i.e classification of root cause, locating earthquakes) are not necessary 

2. Characteristics of waveforms:
    - Typical 0.5s transmission latency from seismic station to laptop
    - Seismographs in Finland have nm/s precision
    - Waveforms from different stations might look similar as they are generated by sensor arrays placed close to one another
    -  Typical velocity of P and S waves are 6.8km/s and 5.3km/s, affected by finnish geology, density of rocks, temperature, amount of liquid in rocks
    - Seismographs usually have a 200-300 km detection limit. 
    - Most finnish earthquakes have <1-2 magnitude
    - Finland has hard solid bedrock, so energy does not get lost easily
    - Frequency changes typically mark the transition from noise to P or S waves
    - \>4-5 stations needed to accurately determine location of earthquake. Calculations are done using a solver thats already robust
    - Frequency of waves vary between earthquakes. ISUH usually bandpasses between 2 and 8 Hz
    - P and S waves could have 15-20s separation

3. ISUH to follow up with:
    - ISUH to share slides presented in the meeting
    - ISUH to provide earthquake catalog in quakeML format
    - ISUH to provide STA/LTA threshold values they use
    - (If needed) ISUH to reach out to EQCCT authors to obtain EQCCT training API
